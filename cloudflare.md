This CloudFlare app adds a simple text message at the top of your website if the visitor's browser version is too old. If the visitor is using Internet Explorer 6 or 7 (any version lower than 8), the message will appear, with a link to [ABetterBrowser.org](http://abetterbrowser.org/). There are links to five different modern browsers there, including the most recent version of Internet Explorer.
