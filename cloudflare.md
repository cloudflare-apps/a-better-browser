This CloudFlare app adds a simple text message at the top of your website if the visitor's browser version is too old.

If the visitor is using Internet Explorer 6 or 7 (any version lower than 8), the message will appear, with a link to [ABetterBrowser.org](http://abetterbrowser.org/).

The message reads:

> You are using an outdated browser. [More information &#187;](http://abetterbrowser.org/)

There are links to five different modern browsers there, including the most recent version of Internet Explorer.

### Styling the message

You can style the message however you want! All you need to do is add styles with id *#cloudflare-old-browser*

### Sourcecode
