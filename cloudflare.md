This CloudFlare app adds a simple text message at the top of your website if the visitor's browser version is too old.

If the visitor is using an Internet Explorer version less than or equal to specified in the app configuration, the message will appear, with a link to [WhatBrowser.org](http://www.whatbrowser.org/). By default, this message will be displayed in IE8 and lower.

There are links to four different modern browsers at WhatBrowser.org, including the most recent version of user's current browser.

Note: Internet Explorer 9's [Compatibility view](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/products/ie-9/features/compatibility-view) will trigger the message, since the browser pretends to be an earlier version of Internet Explorer.

*This app was inspired by ABetterBrowser.org, though it's since been updated to point to WhatBrowser.org for a smoother user experience.*

#### Styling the message
You can style the message however you want! All you need to do is add styles with id *#cloudflare-old-browser*. View source code for more details.

Additionally it adds class *cloudflare-old-browser-body* to document's body, if you'd like to push website's content down, so it won't be blocked by this message.
